      <description>Having never Python before, I found regular expressions to be incredibly useful and interesting. At first it was difficult to figure out the meaning of all of the symbols and how to use them. However, I eventualy got the hang of it and was able to use extract information from text by searching for a specific pattern. Regex is cruical for reformatting and cleaning data as well as web scrapping.</description>
