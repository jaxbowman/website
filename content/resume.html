<h2>Biography</h2>
<p>My name is Jaxon Bowman, and I am a senior biology student at UT Austin. I am currently a pre-med student, hoping to attend medical school and become a pediatric cardiologist! Another goal of mine to be a part of Doctors without Borders and help provide medical care to people in developing countries. On campus, I am involved in Global Medical Training, and I have been on one medical mission trip to The Dominican Republic! Fun fact: I just ran my first half marathon!</p>
